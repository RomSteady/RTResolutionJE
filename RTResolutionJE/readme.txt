Unzip somewhere OTHER than the same folder that Terraria is installed to.

This version of the software has been tested using Terraria 1.4.4.9 on a 4K monitor.

This version of the software requires .NET Framework 4.8.0 be installed.

To use:

    Unzip to somewhere other than where Terraria is installed.
    Right-click on Terraria in Steam, go to Properties, go to Local Files, and then Verify Integrity of Game Cache.  Every crash I've looked at so far has been caused either by the game itself or a bad file somewhere.  This also resets your Terraria installation to the latest version of the game.
    Run Terraria once to make sure it runs for you.
    Run RTResolutionJE.exe.
    Open your Terraria folder on Steam.
    Rename Terraria.exe to Terraria.Original.exe.
    Copy Terraria.exe from your Terraria save game folder to your Terraria folder.
    Launch the game from Steam.
